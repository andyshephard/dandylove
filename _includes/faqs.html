                <h3>Is it really going to be a vegan wedding? I like meat. Can't you make a special meal for me?</h3>
                <p class="text-faded">Respectfully, no. If you've been invited to this wonderful day of ours, you'll already know that Dani is a loving vegan. Being her special day, we'd like to ask our guests to try something new. Who knows, this might be the first day of an exciting vegan adventure for you :)</p>
